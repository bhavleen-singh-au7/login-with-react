# Login/SignUp with React

In the learning phase of React, I want to build a simple project which contains:

- Home/Landing Page
- SignUp Page
- Login Page
- Dashboard (which is protected showing user information)

I'm doing this without Database, storing user information on the `DB.json` file which is inside `src` folder.

Also deploying this web app to Heroku because in past I learned to deploy on GitHub Pages and Netlify now learning to deploy on Heroku.
